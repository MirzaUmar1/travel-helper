# TravelHelper
Travel search website fetching some examples from a JSON file. This project is my submission for the JavaScript Programming Essentials course as part of the **IBM Full Stack Developer** pathway.

# Purpose
This simple website allows a user to search travel ideas and provides the user with recommendations on where to visit.

# Project Focus
The project focuses on creating a simple dynamic webpage using JavaScript. This includes fetchning data for recommendations from a local JSON file, and adding in dynamic updates to the page following user interactions. For style and ease, the **Bootstrap** framework is used.
